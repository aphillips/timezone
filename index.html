<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>One common requirement for applications is the need to deal with dates, times, or durations. Working with time-related data can be complex because values are related to calendars and timekeeping rules, which themselves can be somewhat arcane. One of these complexities in working with time-related data is the effect of time zone on the handling and presentation of the data.</p>

<p>This document contains guidelines and best practices for working with date and time values, including time zones, in applications and document formats. Use cases are provided to help choose an approach that ensures that geographically distributed applications work well with date and time values.

<h2>Why You Should Read This</h2>

<p>Working with date and time values, including the effect of time zones on the display and processing of these values, can be confusing. By understanding how date and time values work and how to manage these values in applications or specify them in standards, you can prevent many problems.</p>

<p>When working with date and time values, the time zone, the <a>locale</a>, and your choices for encoding, handling, and processing date and time values can produce different and perhaps unexpected or unwanted results. Some examples of errors due to improper date/time handling might include the items listed below. Reading the best practices and guidelines in this document can help you create specifications, designs, or implementations that avoid errors when working with time values.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two people schedule a recurring phone call using a phone application. They set it up to start on a particular day of the week at a particular time. Sometimes the reminder comes too early to either one of the people. Sometimes it comes too late. Sometimes the phone application won't let the users in because the call is "already over".</li>
    <li>A customer is eligible for a discount on their birthday, but when they log in on their birthday, they can't access the discount.</li>
    <li>An website tracks customer loyalty by keeping track of the number of days that customer visited the site. The site shows gaps when the user travels, even though the customer logged in every day.</li>
    <li>A business-critical regularly-scheduled process fails to run, but only on certain days of the year.</li>

<h2 id="howToUse">Concepts</h2>

<p>This section provides the basic concepts, terminology, and background for those unfamiliar with the origins, processing, and representation of date and time values in modern computer systems.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="history">A Brief History of Timekeeping</h2>

<p>Computer systems tell time differently than people do. So it is helpful to understand how time works within computers as well as in the real world in order to get a handle on how to get the results that you want. This description is necessarily simplified.</p>

<p>Timekeeping has its roots in observable celestial events, such as sunrise, sunset, the longest/shortest day of the year, the phases of the moon, or the position of the constellations. This is called <a>observed time</a> and underpins the various customary systems for measuring time.</p>

<p>Conventions have been established by various cultures to organize time into more convenient units. For example, days are broken up into arbitrary units such as hours, minutes, and seconds or grouped together to form weeks. Years are broken up into months. They are also numbered starting from significant events or organized into <a>eras</a>. Each unique cultural system for organizing time forms a <a>calendar</a> or <a>chronology</a>.</p>

<p>Gradually, over time, most chronologies have weakened or sometimes removed some of the ties to the original observational basis for events. For example, the Gregorian calendar's months do not correspond to the lunar cycle. Other calendars retain stronger linkages to specific celestial events. For example, most Islamic calendars use actual solar or lunar observations to determine the start of specific periods or months.</p>

<p>Mechanical timekeeping allows for more precision and standardization in counting or measuring events. We refer to the dates and times experienced in a given location as <a>wall time</a> because the date or time can be read from a printed calendar or a clock mounted on the wall.</p>

<p>The advent of speed-of-light communication (such as the telegraph) and efficient means of travel (such as railroads) meant that timekeeping based on local observations (such as "local noon") became inconvenient: it is difficult to manage schedules when each locality keeps its own clock! Even relatively small travel distances produce measurable differences in observed time. As a result, synchronization of different regions that observe the same calendar and <a>wall time</a> became necessary, resulting in the advent of time zones.</p>

<p><a>Observed time</a> has many disadvantages computationally. Observed events are not always predictable or convenient to use. The advent of mechanical timekeeping has allowed a different kind of time to flourish: <a>incremental time</a> based on a monotonic progression of fixed units. In some cases, incremental time is merely a prediction of when an event might be observed.</p>

<p>The modern standardized system of timekeeping in computer systems is generally based on a few core standards. <a>Universal Coordinated Time</a> (or "UTC"), adopted in 1972 CE, is used for global synchronization of clocks and to define local time zone variations. Many systems set computer clocks using the UNIX epoch (counting time from January 1, 1970 in UTC). Standards such as [[ISO8601]] or [[RFC3339]] provide serialization schemes for the interchange of date and time values and most programming languagues or data formats provide data structures for storing or exchanging date and time values. These types of systems are usually based on the <a>ISO Chronology</a> (also known as the <em>Gregorian calendar</em>), although they can be converted to other systems, such as the one of the Islamic calendars, the Ethiopic or Chinese solar-lunar calendars, and so forth.</p>



<section id="what-is-time-zone">
<h3>What is a Time Zone?</h3>

<p>A time zone is a set of rules for determining the local observed time (<a>wall time</a>) as it relates to <a>incremental time</a> (as used in most computing systems) for a particular geographical region.</p>

<p>Before the adoption of time zones, local time was derived directly from observation. Clocks might be set, for example, based on an observed event such as local noon. Traveling fairly short distances across the Earth's surface results in changes in local observed time: you only have to travel about 28 kilometers (17 miles) at the equator (and less distance the further north or south of the equator you are) to alter the observed local noon by one minute.</p>

<p>Time zones were originated in several countries by railroad operators. Before time zones were instituted, it was difficult know when trains would arrive or depart because local wall time might vary significantly from one station to another. This also made it difficult to schedule traffic across the rail network.</p>

<p>Railroads solved this problem by adopting fixed regions in which the same local time was used throughout. These "time zones" were intended to be about one observed hour wide: the local time in the middle of the time zone was used throughout the region so that the most observational deviation most people would see was about half an hour (and, assuming the population is evenly distributed, most people experienced a smaller deviation). This is a value small enough that most people won't notice the difference between actual and observed time.</p>

<p>In the modern era, most countries have a single time zone, but a number of larger or more geographically distributed countries have more than one.</p>

<section id="summer-time">
<h4>Daylight Savings or Summer Time</h4>

<p>The concept of "Daylight Saving Time" (DST) or "Summer Time" is used as a way of allowing people more sunlight hours in the evening. Not all regions observe summer time: usually those nearer the equator do not need it. Whether summer time is observed and how it is observed varies by jurisdiction.</p>

<p>As the name implies, areas that use some form of "summer time" do so in the summer season. That is, they change their UTC offset forward (usually by one hour) sometime in the spring and the reverse when the observation of summer time ends in the autumn. Since "spring" and "autumn" happen in opposite parts of the year in the northern and southern hemispheres, the starting and ending days are different for time zones in opposite hemispheres.</p>

<p>Observation (or non-observation) of summer time is controlled by national, regional, and sometimes local governments. Regions that otherwise share a UTC offset, even those with similar latitude (or shared borders) can have differing summer time start or stop rules. Sometimes local authorities will make one-time changes to accommodate a special event (such as when hosting the Olympics). Governments sometimes change whether summer time is observed as well as changing when summer time begins or ends.</p>

</section>

<section id="tz-definition">
<h4>Definition and Mutability of Time Zones</h4>

<p>While other schemes exist, many applications use the <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA Time Zone Database</a> [[RFC6557]] and its associated set of identifiers to define time zones.</p>

<p>Time zones, their rules, offsets, and observation (or non-observation) of summer time are controlled by a variety of international agreements, as well as national, regional, sub-national, and local governments. This can mean that neighboring areas that might otherwise share a UTC offset, even those with similar latitude (or shared borders) can have differing rules, such as those governing daylight-savings. Sometimes local authorities will change the boundaries of a zone or the offset used by a given region. Or they can make one-time changes to accommodate a special event (such as when hosting the Olympics). The time zone database tracks past changes so that applications can accurately compute <a>wall time</a> for past and future events.</p>

<p>Because there are many governing bodies acting independently, the time zone database is not stabilized. New rule changes or updates to historical records are introduced into the database as they are made known (such as due to legislative action). There is no specific release cycle: updates can happen at any time. When changes affect future events, computing systems have to be updated lest their clocks show the wrong local time for a given region.</p>

<p>Time zones are defined by these considerations:</p>

    <ul>
       <li><strong><a>Local Time Offset</a></strong> All time zones have, as their basis, an offset from <a>UTC</a>. The local time offset is the difference (positive or negative) between when a given time event is observed in UTC and in local time. If all time zones used one-hour offsets, there would be 24 world-wide time zones, ranging between 12 hours before UTC to 11 hours following UTC. However, there are some that use half-hour or even quarter-hour offsets (or even some odd offsets). In addition, some time zones fall outside a single-day span.</li>
       <li><strong>Observation of summer time</strong> Some times zones include rules for observing summer time, while others do not. The observation of summer time is defined by a set of rules that include:
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Summer time offset</strong> The amount of time added to (or subtracted from) the <a>local time offset</a> when summer time is being observed. Nowadays this is always one hour, but other values are theoretically possible (and have been used historically).</li>
           <li><strong>Starting date</strong> Usually described as a specific date on a specific calendar, such as the "first Sunday in April"</li>
           <li><strong>Starting time</strong> The time of day when the switch occurs, such as "2 AM"</li>
           <li><strong>Ending date</strong> Like the starting date, the date on which to switch back to "standard time"</li>
           <li><strong>Ending time</strong> The time of day when the switch occurs, such as "2 AM"</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><strong>Adoption Dates</strong> Regions that currently have a specific local time offset and summer time behavior may have had different rules in the past. Correct handling of past time values requires treating such regions as separate time zones.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="example">
        <p>Adoption dates can be applied to any of the values that define a time zone, such as the amount of summer time offset and the starting/ending dates or times for summer time. For example, prior to 2007, the United States started daylight-savings time at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday in April for each time zone observing daylight-savings. In 2007, the USA changed the start date and time to 2 a.m. on the second Sunday in March.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside class="example">
		<p>Korea Standard Time and Japan Standard Time currently use the same UTC offset and neither uses summer time. However, Japan abandoned summer time in 1951, while South Korea used it last in 1988, so an application that tracks time values that reach back that far might need to track these time zones separately.</p>

<section id="incremental-times">
<h3>Incremental Time</h3>

<p><a>Incremental time</a> measures time using fixed integer units that increase monotonically from a specific point in time (called the "epoch"). Most programming languages and operating environments provide or use incremental time for working with time values. Incremental time is not usually seen directly by users, but is formatted into <a>wall time</a> for human consumption.</p>

<p>Date and time values based on incremental time are time-zone-independent, since at any given moment it is the same time in UTC everywhere: the values can be transformed for display for any particular time zone or offset, but the value itself is not tied to a specific location.</p>

<p>Not all incremental time representations are tied to an <a>epoch</a>. A monotonic clock system might just be tied to the last time the hardware clock was restarted or some other event.</p>

<p>Since incremental time values are just integers, any two time values can be put into order as a sequence of events just by comparing the values. That is, any set of incremental time values attached to a specific <a>chronology</a> form a <a>timeline</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="floating-times">
<h3>Floating Time</h3>

<p>A <a>floating time</a> is a date or time value in a <a>calendar</a> that is not a specific <a>instant</a> in time, that is, it is not an <a>instant</a> in a <a>chronology</a> on a <a>timeline</a>. Floating time values are also independent of a specific time zone.</p>

<p>Applications and data formats need <a>floating time</a> values when <a>wall time</a> is more important to the value than putting the event into a <a>chronology</a>. This makes them useful for when an event can apply to many different time values or are independent of location. Examples of floating date values include your birthdate, holidays, or anniversary dates. Floating time values can include things such as hours of operation (as a policy, rather than for a specific location).</p>

<aside class="example">
   <p>For example, the French national holiday Bastille Day (<em lang="fr">Fête Nationale</em>) is observed on July 14th each year. Thus the 2022 occurence might be represented by the value <code>2022-07-14</code>. However, the observation of the holiday isn't tied to any specific location. Instead, its meaning "floats" based on locally observed midnight.</p>

   <p>France has a number of overseas departments which do not share a time zone with Metropolitan France. In this example, we'll look at three French time zones: <code>Europe/Paris</code>, <code>Pacific/Noumea</code> (the time zone used in New Caledonia), and <code>Pacific/Tahiti</code> (one of the timezones in French Polynesia).</p>

   <p>New Caledonia is one of (but not the) first time zones in France to observe the holiday. Tahiti is one of (but not the) last in France to observe it. The table below shows the dates and times in each of the time zones as Bastille Day is observed around the world. Notice that some time incremental time values that would be "Bastille Day" in one time zone are either before or after "Bastille Day" in others:</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

 <p class=issue>I've adopted mostly Java/Joda's terminology here (chronology) vs. using other terms (such as 'calendar').</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="lint-ignore export">Chronology</dfn> or <dfn id="calendar">calendar</dfn> A timekeeping system used to organize dates and times.</p>
 
 <p>Many different chronologies and calendars have been used or are in use today around the world. These different systems have varying rules for organizing and dividing time values.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="lint-ignore export">ISO Chronology</dfn> is based on the [[ISO8601]] standard, which is the <em>de facto</em> world calendar. This system is based on the Gregorian calendar.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="link-ignore export">Observed Time</dfn> A moment in time based on an observed event or events. For example, "local noon", the shortest day or the year, or the first new moon.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="link-ignore export">Wall Time</dfn> (Informal) A date or time value as experienced by human beings, so called because the value might be what is shown on a paper calendar or analog clock mounted on the wall in a given location at a given moment.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="link-ignore export">Epoch</dfn> A specific moment in time that serves as a reference point for a given <a>chronology</a>. The most common epoch is the Unix Epoch, which is used by the most common computer timekeeping systems and measures incremental time values from midnight, January 1, 1970 in the UTC time zone, i.e. from <code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z</code></p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="lint-ignore export">Era</dfn> A grouping within a <a>calendar</a> used to number years. Most eras start with year "1" and count up to the start of the next era. There are some exceptions to this: the Gregorian calendar's era "BCE" counts backwards, with 1 BCE being the year just before 1 CE (1 AD).</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="lint-ignore export">Timeline</dfn> In a given chronology, the fixed sequence of moments, measured against the <a>epoch</a>. A datetime value is said to be <em>on the timeline</em> if it is attached to a discrete moment in time. This is a hallmark of incremental time values.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="link-ignore export">Incremental Time</dfn> A datetime value consisting of monotonically increasing integer units measured from a specific moment in time (<a>epoch</a>). For example, the moment <code>1970-01-02T00:00:00.000Z</code> might have an incremental time value (measured in milliseconds) of <code>86400000</code>, since there are 86,400 seconds in a day and 1000 ms in a second.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn data-lt="floating time|plain time|local time" class="link-ignore export">Floating Time</dfn> A date or time value that is not fixed to a specific incremental time value or time zone. When you apply time zone information to floating times they produce a range of acceptable incremental time values, because they represent a nominal time which is described in the same way in all time zones around the world.</p>
 
 <p class=definition><dfn class="lint-ignore export">Instant</dfn> An <a>incremental time</a> in the Unix <a>epoch</a>. An instant can be converted for display in any <a>calendar</a> and/or time zone and any two instants can be ordered in time.</p>
 
 <aside class="note">Java and HTML call a floating time value a <a data-cite="html#date-time-local">local date and time</a>. JavaScript Temporal calls it a "plain" time.</aside>
 
  <p class=definition><dfn data-lt="universal coordinated time|UTC">Universal Coordinated Time</dfn> or <strong>UTC</strong> is the basis for modern timekeeping. Among other things, it provides a common baseline for converting between incremental and wall time. UTC is also known as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). There are some subtle differences between the two, but none that the average person would notice. The time zone offset for UTC is <code>0</code>. UTC is often indicated in field-based formats using <code>Z</code>.</p>
  
 <p class=definition><dfn class="link-ignore export">Local Time Offset</dfn> The different (positive or negative) of a given location from <a>UTC</a>. This is usually expressed as an offset in hours and minutes, such as <code>+10:00</code> or <code>-09:30</code>.</p>

<p class=issue>Some of the serializations in this section are not currently part of any standard. Work at the IETF on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended/">SEDATE</a> might address this gap. Other standards, such as XMLSchema might be affected.</p>

	<h2>Use Cases</h2>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways applications can use date and time values. In this section we examine the different common use cases and the serializations or data structures to use for each.</p>
	
<section>
	<h3>Timestamps</h3>
	
	<p class="advisement">Use the <code>Instant</code> type for timestamp values.</p>

	<p>If your application can accurately generate incremental and/or field-based times based on UTC and the events are not tied to specific local time, all that is needed is the timestamp value itself. That is, if your application never needs to recover what the actual wall time was when event occurred and only cares about relative ordering of events. For example, if you merge log files from many machines together or if you are recording events in a log, a timestamp is perfectly adequate. For these types of time events, an Instant is sufficient.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is often desirable to normalize time values to UTC (or a specific UTC offset) so that separate series of data can be easily compared and merged. Information about local offset may be valuable in recovering the actual wall time, but time zone rules are probably only rarely interesting.</p>
    
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Handling past or future events</h3>
	
	<p>Many applications need to work with events that have already occurred, events in the future, or both. When working with these types of values, additional care needs to be used to avoid problems with the way that time zones interact with event planning.</p>
	
	<aside class="example" title="Example of time zone change effects on a future event">
	<p>For example, consider an application that defines certificates. Each certificate has a date-time value that is the "start of authority" (<code>validFrom</code>) moment and a date-time value that is the "end of authority" (<code>validUntil</code>) moment.</p>
	
	<p>Imagine that Certificate A is generated in the time zone <code>America/Los_Angeles</code>. This time zone has a raw offset from UTC of 8 hours and it currently observes daylight savings time between a date in March and a date in November. Certificate A is generated with a <code>validUntil</code> value of <code>2035-07-12T12:00:00-07:00</code>, reflecting the observation of DST during the month of July.</p>
	
	<p>After Certificate A was generated (but before it expires), imagine that the time zone <code>America/Los_Angeles</code> decides to stop observing daylight savings time. Then imagine a user wishes to generate Certificate B to replace Certificate A when it expires. If the new certificate is valid "from noon on 12 July", it might be serialized as <code>2035-07-12T12:00:00-08:00</code>, because the time zone's offset will not be in DST any longer. Notice that this is one hour later than the actual expiration of Certificate A.</p>
	</aside>
	
<section>
	<h3>Past-only Events</h3>
	
	<p class="advisement">You SHOULD use <code>ZonedInstant</code> type for past-only events.</p>
	<p class="advisement">You MAY use <code>ZonedInstant</code>, <code>ZonedLocalDateTime</code> or <code>ZonedOffsetDateTime</code> types for past events.</p>
	
	<p>For applications that deal only with events that occurred in the past (with no future events) and for which you need to know what the wall time was, the time zone of the event may be necessary additional data. Once an event is in the past, its relationship to incremental time becomes fixed and the rules for generating wall time remain static essentially forever. You might still need to know that an event occurred at <code>10:00</code> rather than at <code>14:00</code> local time. At a minimum, the <a>local time offset</a> is necessary, although knowing the complete time zone is necessary for some applications. Knowing the specific time zone allows one to reconstruct the time and its relationship to other wall times.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Past and Future Events</h3>
	
	<p class="advisement">You SHOULD use <code>ZonedInstant</code> type if your application can have events in the future.</p>
	
	<p>If your application deals with both past and future events (for example, if you have a calendar or a meeting schedule), you’ll need additional time zone information to ensure proper time computation. At a minimum you will need the time zone, not merely an offset from UTC. This is because a future event's wall time depends on time zone related information, such as DST transitions. One issue with future events is that time zone rules can change from time to time and these may require an application to update affected data records in order to meet user’s expectations. This is because many systems actually store the time portion of the value as an incremental time and the incremental time needs to be changed if the wall time offset from UTC has been altered.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Recurring Events</h3>
	
	<p>A recurring event, such as a regular meeting, is usually defined by a set of rules that express a user's intent. In some cases, the user intends for the event to recur at a specific local time (and thus, wants to tie it to local time changes, such as DST transitions). In other cases, the user wants the time tied to another time zone, to a specific UTC offset, or to other events. So, for example, a recurring weekly event might need to add 167, 168, or 169 hours to "last week's occurrence" of an event to compute this week's start time, depending on whether a DST transition has occurred and which direction the transition was in.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Floating Time Values</h3>
	
	<p class="advisement">You SHOULD use the appropriate floating time type, such as <code>LocalDateTime</code> (for values with both date and time), <code>LocalDate</code> (for date values), or <code>LocalTime</code> (for time-only values) for values that are not tied to a specific offset or time zone rules.</p>
	
	<p>If your application deals with a date or time value that is not tied to a specific local interpretation or which needs to be interpreted as a different range of incremental time values in different locations, serializing the value without an offset or time zone identifer communicates that the value is a <a>floating time</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Floating and Unfloating Time</h3>
	
	<p>Sometimes a <a>producer</a> will emit a <a>floating time</a> value when the <a data-cite="i18n-glossary#consumer">consumer</a> expects or requires an <a>incremental time</a> value. In other cases, a <a data-cite="i18n-glossary#consumer">consumer</a> might need to convert a local or otherwise incremental time value into a floating date or time.</p>
	
	<p class="definition"><dfn class="link-ignore export">Floating a time value</dfn> means to remove the value from the timeline by deleting any associated time zone and zone offset information from the value.</p>
	
	<p>One common reason to float a value is if the data type used to collect or process the value is an incremental type but the value isn't. For example, if you received a user's birth date as a `Date` object. Removing the time zone or offset makes it easier to format the value later without the field values changing in correctly.</p>
	
	<p class="definition"><dfn  class="link-ignore export">Unfloating a time value</dfn> means to attach a floating time value to the timeline by adding a time zone or zone offset to the value.</p>
	
	<p>One common reason to unfloat a value is that the serialized value might not contain an offset but the value needs to be compared to other incremental values or displayed to the user in local time.</p>
	
	<p class="advisement">Values received without a time zone or zone offset SHOULD generally be treated as if they are in UTC. Specifications SHOULD provide guidance on how to handle these values. Implementations MAY use some other value for the offset, such as local time, but only if there is a good reason to do so.</p>

	<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

<section>
	<h3>Time Zone Identifiers</h3>
	
	<!-- ed note: RFC6557 is BCP175 -->
	<p>The most definitive reference for identifying sets of time zone rules is the IANA Timezone Database [[RFC6557]], which is used by systems such as various Linux distributions, Java, CLDR, ICU, and many other systems and libraries. Other systems exist: for example, Microsoft Windows uses its own data set and identifiers.</p>

    <p>In the TZ database, time zones are given IDs that usually consist of a region and exemplar city. Regions can be continents (such as Europe or America) or oceans (such as Atlantic or Pacific). An exemplar city is a city in the time zone in question that should be well-known to people using the time zone. The TZ database also supplies aliases for many IDs; for example, <kbd>Asia/Ulan Bator</kbd> is equivalent to <kbd>Asia/Ulaanbaatar</kbd>. The Common Locale Data Repository [[CLDR]] can be used to provide a localized form for the IDs: see Appendix J in [[UAX35]]. Note: some systems, such as Apple Inc.'s MacOS, provide additional exemplar cities.</p>

	<h3>Selecting the Time Zone using the Local Time Offset</h3>
	
	<p>Most countries are either small enough in area or, for practical reasons, choose to observe only a single time zone for the entire country. This means that knowing the region or country of the user is frequently sufficient to identify the time zone of the user as well. At the time this document was published, only twenty countries had more than one observed time zone. These countries are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, France, Greenland, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, Mexico, Micronesia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and the United States.</p>

    <p>Some special cases exist within this list:</p>

    <ul>
       <li><strong>Countries with maritime or overseas possessions</strong> Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, and Portugal each have islands or other wide-ranging geographic areas far from the main part of the country. For example, Easter Island is part of Chile, the Galapagos Islands are part of Ecuador, and the Azores are part of Portugal. These offshore possessions are the source of additional time zones in each of these countries.</li>
       <li><strong>France</strong> France is a special case of the above. There are several regions that are part of France, even though they might have their own ISO 3166-1 code. These include Reunion Island (in the Indian Ocean) and French Guiana (in South America). Additionally, French Polynesia is divided into three time zones.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Within each of the countries that observe multiple time zones, knowing the current offset and current time will usually allow you to determine the time zone accurately. An exception to this is the United States: there exist some regions, such as Arizona, whose time zone cannot be determined strictly from the current time, country/region code, and offset, although an inferred time zone will always work for current time applications (not future and past times).</p>

<section>
<h3>Leap Seconds</h3>
	
	<p>One quirk of timekeeping is the need for leap seconds. The Earth's rotation is not even and, in general, is slowing down. To keep <a>observed time</a> and <a>incremental time</a> in sync, the [<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/">International Earth Rotation Service</a>] occasionally mandates a "leap second". A leap second usually occurs once or sometimes twice per year and always takes the form of an additional second added to the last minute of the day. Usually the leap second is added to December 31st or June 30th.</p>

    <p>Most incremental time values (do not keep track of leap seconds in their incremental time values. What happens is:</p>

    <ol>
		<li>Eventually, system clocks are updated externally by the user or via a service such as NTP. Most computer clocks exhibit some amount of clock drift anyway, so this sort of maintenance is not unusual.</li>
        <li>No list is kept of past or future leap seconds (and no list exists for dates preceding the advent of leap seconds in 1972), so software often doesn't include leap seconds when calculating the difference between two time values. For example, the difference between 12:00:00 Noon on December 31st and 12:00:00 Noon on the following January 1st will always be 86400 seconds, even if a leap second was mandated for the intervening midnight.</li>
        <li>There may be no way to represent a leap second time value using your local incremental units and may not be a means of representing a leap second using field-based units. For example, while Java's <code>java.util.Calendar</code> class allows for a "61st" second of a minute to accommodate leap seconds, if you set a Java Calendar to <kbd>December 31, 2008 23:59:60 UTC</kbd> (a particular leap second value) and then convert that to a <code>java.util.Date</code> in order to print it out, you might see: "January 1, 2009 00:00:00 UTC" because the <code>Date</code> object cannot represent leap second values.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>If your application cares about or is sensitive to leap seconds, special care must be taken to deal with the loss of leap second precision.</p>
